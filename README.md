# Power-BI-Project

Automated Data Segregation and Visualization Dashboard
This Power BI project leverages Outlook, Power Automate, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), API integration, Python, and ChatGPT to streamline data processing and visualization. The project automates the entire data pipeline—from segregating raw files to generating dynamic dashboards with advanced DAX formulas.

# Key Features:
* Automated Data Segregation – Outlook automatically organizes incoming data files using predefined rules.
* Power Automate Workflow – A custom workflow automates data extraction and processing, reducing manual effort.
* API Development (Google Cloud Platform) – A REST API was created on GCP to facilitate secure and scalable data retrieval. 
* Python Script for Outlook Data Extraction – Using ChatGPT assistance, a Python script fetches and processes Outlook data efficiently.
* Advanced DAX Formulas – Implemented for financial calculations, trend analysis, and KPI tracking.
* Interactive Power BI Dashboard – Provides real-time insights with drill-down capabilities for data-driven decision-making.

This project enhances efficiency, accuracy, and automation in data analytics by integrating cloud computing, AI, and automation tools to optimize workflow and reporting.
